# User Namer
The purpose of this application is to allow people to create usernames and passwords at the click of a button.
It should be easily customizable, and be able to meet the various requirements that usernames and passwords have.
This project was a joint effort by Abdeali Daginawala, Daniell Zheng, Hassan Abdi.
This project was an effort to expand my skillset to include some web development programming.
